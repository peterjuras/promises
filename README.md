# JavaScript promises

This repo contains scenarios for JavaScript promises.
It is used in a live presentation, therefore the files individually might not make sense.

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- yarn v1

## Getting started

Before running any scenarios you have to install dependencies:

- Run `yarn`

Afterwards, you can start from `scenario-00.md` and then proceed through the different scenarios.

I recommend Visual Studio Code to adjust & run the scenarios, with a couple of extension recommendations that are used in the scenarios:

- httpbook - for sending requests from `.http` files
- code-runner - to quickly run code from the scenarios
